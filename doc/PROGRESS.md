# CARLA Rust Client Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation progress of the CARLA Rust client library, which provides safe Rust bindings to CARLA's C++ client library through a layered architecture:

```
carla (High-level Rust API) -> carla-sys (FFI/CXX) -> CARLA C++ Client Library
```

## Current Design (2025-01)

### Architecture
- **carla-sys**: Low-level FFI bindings using CXX for C++ interoperability
- **carla**: High-level, idiomatic Rust API with zero-copy wrappers
- **carla-src**: Build system for CARLA C++ client library

### Key Design Decisions
1. **CXX over autocxx**: Migrated for better stability and performance
2. **Zero-copy wrappers**: Using `UniquePtr` and `SharedPtr` for collections
3. **Trait-based design**: `ActorExt` trait for all actor types with downcasting
4. **Test framework**: Using `cargo nextest` for better test isolation
5. **Examples over tests**: Migrated integration tests to comprehensive examples
6. **Vector wrapper pattern**: C++ `std::vector<T>` wrapped as Rust types

### Vector Wrapper Design Pattern
When C++ functions return `Vec<SharedPtr<T>>` or `Vec<X>` types, we create wrapper types in Rust:

```rust
// Example: ActorList wrapper for Vec<SharedPtr<Actor>>
pub struct ActorList {
    inner: UniquePtr<ffi::ActorVector>,
}

impl ActorList {
    // Vec-like interface
    pub fn len(&self) -> usize { self.inner.size() }
    pub fn is_empty(&self) -> bool { self.inner.empty() }
    pub fn get(&self, index: usize) -> Option<Actor> { ... }
    pub fn iter(&self) -> ActorListIter { ... }
}

// Implement IntoIterator for ergonomic use
impl IntoIterator for ActorList {
    type Item = Actor;
    type IntoIter = ActorListIntoIter;
    fn into_iter(self) -> Self::IntoIter { ... }
}
```

**Existing Vector Wrappers:**
- `ActorList` - wraps `std::vector<SharedPtr<Actor>>`
- `BlueprintList` - wraps `std::vector<ActorBlueprint>`
- `TransformList` - wraps `std::vector<Transform>`
- `WaypointList` - wraps `std::vector<SharedPtr<Waypoint>>`
- `ActorIdList` - wraps `std::vector<ActorId>`

**Benefits:**
- Zero-copy access to C++ data
- Rust-idiomatic APIs (iterator, index, etc.)
- Type safety without FFI exposure
- Efficient memory management

### 📝 Advanced Features (Available for Future)

- 📅 ROS2 native integration (future enhancement)
- 📅 OpenDRIVE file generation (future enhancement)
- 📅 Async/await support for sensors and callbacks (future enhancement)

## CARLA 0.10.0 Known Issues (From doc/ACTOR.md Testing)

### Server Stability Problems
1. **Frequent Crashes**: Server segfaults when accessing vehicle properties
2. **Actor Lifecycle**: Actors may be destroyed immediately after spawning
3. **Missing Subsystems**: Traffic Manager not available, causing autopilot crashes
4. **Property Access**: Getting transform/velocity can crash with std::exception

### Observed Crash Patterns
- `Signal 11 caught` - Segmentation faults in server
- `std::exception` - When destroying infrastructure actors
- `is_alive()` returns false immediately after spawn
- Autopilot enabling crashes without Traffic Manager

### Workarounds Required
- Check `is_alive()` before any actor operation
- Avoid accessing transform/velocity on vehicles
- Skip autopilot functionality until Traffic Manager available
- Handle actor destruction errors gracefully
- Implement retry logic for spawn operations

## carla-sys C++ FFI TODOs

### Found in Code Comments

#### Sensor Callbacks (ffi.rs:1546)
```rust
// TODO: True callback support requires different CXX approach
// These functions exist but need CXX-compatible signatures
```
- The C++ implementation for sensor callbacks exists in `carla_sys_bridge.cpp`
- Functions are implemented: `Sensor_RegisterCallback`, `Sensor_UnregisterCallback`, `Sensor_ClearCallbacks`
- Issue: CXX doesn't support function pointers in the way needed for callbacks
- Current workaround: Functions are commented out in FFI definition

#### Landmark Wrapper (map.rs:508)
```rust
// TODO: Landmark wrapper disabled for now due to CXX compatibility issues
// pub struct LandmarkWrapper { ... }
```
- Landmark functionality exists in C++ but wrapper is disabled
- Issue: CXX compatibility with the landmark data structures

### Implementation Notes

#### Sensor Listen Function
- Current implementation uses global storage (`g_last_sensor_data`) as a workaround
- Proper callback system is implemented in `sensor_callback_bridge.cpp` but needs CXX bridge fixes

#### ROS Integration
- `Sensor_DisableForROS` and `Sensor_IsEnabledForROS` are implemented as no-ops
- Comments indicate ROS is not enabled from the bindings

### Found and Completed C++ Implementation TODOs

//      1.0f   // Fuel level placeholder (full tank)
// NEW: Dynamic temperature and fuel simulation
```
- ✅ Engine temperature calculation: base_temp + load_factor * 30°C (80-120°C range)
- ✅ Per-vehicle fuel tracking with consumption model based on throttle and speed
- ✅ Realistic vehicle telemetry providing immersive simulation data

**Implementation Details:**
