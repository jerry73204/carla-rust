# Carla Simulator Client Library in Rust

Rust client library for Carla simulator. It is compatible with
simulator version 0.9.14.

It is recommended to fix the clang version to 12 on newer systems such
as Ubuntu 22.04. See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section
to find instructions.

## Documentation

To get started, it's recommended to read the API documentation and
learn from the simple example [here](carla/examples/spawn.rs).

- [API documentation](https://docs.rs/carla)
- [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/carla)
- [Examples](carla/examples)


## Usage

Add `carla` crate to `Cargo.toml` and get everything. You may wait for
longer time to generate Rust bindings in the first build.

If you prefer to manually build Carla C++ client library. Please read
 [this guide](doc/use_prebuilt_client_lib.md) to learn instructions.


## Troubleshooting

### Build failed with clang >= 14 (on Ubuntu 22.04 or newer)

Currently `carla-sys` is unable to build with newer clang version >= 14.
If you are Ubuntu users, it's recommended to configure
clang-sys to use clang 12.

```sh
sudo apt install clang-12 libclang-12-dev
export LLVM_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/bin/llvm-config-12
export LIBCLANG_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-12/lib
export LIBCLANG_STATIC_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-12/lib
export CLANG_PATH=/usr/bin/clang-12
```
