# CARLA Test Codegen

This is a test crate used to verify that code generated by the CARLA code generator compiles correctly.

## Purpose

This crate serves as a compilation target for generated CARLA Rust bindings. It's used by the `make test-codegen` command to:

1. Generate Rust code from CARLA Python API YAML files
2. Place the generated code in this crate's `src/` directory
3. Verify that the generated code compiles without errors

## Structure

```
carla-test-codegen/
├── Cargo.toml         # Crate configuration (kept in version control)
├── README.md          # This file (kept in version control)
└── src/               # Generated code (gitignored)
    ├── lib.rs         # Generated library root
    ├── error.rs       # Generated error types
    ├── carla/         # Generated CARLA types
    └── command/       # Generated command types
```

## Important Notes

- This crate is **excluded from the workspace** to avoid conflicts
- The `src/` directory contents are **generated** and **gitignored**
- Only `Cargo.toml` and `README.md` are kept in version control
- This crate contains `todo!()` placeholders and is not meant for actual use

## Running Tests

To run the code generation test:

```bash
make test-codegen
```

To clean generated files:

```bash
make clean-codegen
```

## Dependencies

The crate includes common dependencies that generated code might need:
- `thiserror` - For error type definitions
- `anyhow` - For error handling (optional)
- `serde` - For serialization (optional)
- `nalgebra` - For linear algebra types (optional)
