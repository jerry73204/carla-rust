#[test]
fn test_macro_compiles() {
    // This test verifies that the macro can be imported and used
    // Actual expansion testing requires more complex setup

    // The macro should exist and be usable
    // Real expansion tests would need trybuild or similar

    // Just verify the crate compiles
    // The test passing means the macro crate compiled successfully
}

// Note: Full macro expansion testing would typically use the `trybuild` crate
// to test compile-time behavior. For now, we ensure the macro is available.
